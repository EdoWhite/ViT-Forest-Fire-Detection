The impact of these events affects both **vegetation and wildlife**. 

This application showcases the **vit-fire-detection** model, a version of google **vit-base-patch16-224-in21k** vision transformer fine-tuned for **smoke and fire detection**. In particular, we can imagine a setup in which webcams, drones, or other recording devices **take pictures of a wild environment every t seconds or minutes**. The proposed system is then able to classify the current situation as **normal, smoke, or fire**.

The fine-tuned model is hosted on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/EdBianchi/vit-fire-detection).

The dataset for fine-tuning process was custom made from different datasets, in particular:

- Samples from "train_fire" and samples from "train_smoke" from [forest-fire dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kutaykutlu/forest-fire?select=train_fire).
- All the samples (mixed together from further splitting) from [forest-fire-images dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohnishsaiprasad/forest-fire-images).
